SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUFFER SIZE TOOLBAR BUTTONS
==================================================

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- js_ReaScriptAPI extension (for window manipulation)
- SWS extension (for getting FX latency/PDC information)
  Download from: https://www.sws-extension.org/

FEATURES:
---------
- Set buffer size to 128 or 1024 with toolbar buttons
- Automatically scans for high PDC (Plugin Delay Compensation) FX when switching to 128
- Option to disable high-latency FX for low-latency recording
- Automatically offers to re-enable disabled FX when switching back to 1024
- Buttons highlight/de-highlight each other (mutually exclusive)
- PDC threshold is configurable (default: 128 samples)

INSTALLATION:
-------------

1. Add both scripts to Reaper:
   - Actions → Show action list
   - Click "New action" → "Load ReaScript"
   - Load "Set block size to 128.lua"
   - Load "Set block size to 1024.lua"

2. Add to toolbar:
   - Right-click on toolbar → Customize toolbar
   - Find both scripts in the action list
   - Drag them to your toolbar
   - Click OK

3. First use:
   - Click each button once
   - This registers their command IDs so they can find each other
   - From then on, clicking one will automatically de-highlight the other

That's it! No manual ID configuration needed.
That's it! No manual ID configuration needed.

4. The buttons will now:
   - Highlight when clicked
   - Automatically de-highlight the other button
   - Set the buffer size accordingly
   - (128 button) Scan for high PDC FX and offer to disable them
   - (1024 button) Offer to re-enable previously disabled FX

USAGE:
------
When switching to 128 buffer (for low-latency recording):
- Script scans all tracks for FX with PDC > 128 samples
- If found, shows a dialog listing the problematic FX
- Options:
  * Yes: Disable the FX and set buffer to 128
  * No: Just set buffer to 128 (keep FX enabled)
  * Cancel: Don't change anything

When switching to 1024 buffer (for mixing/processing):
- If any FX were previously disabled, offers to re-enable them
- Options:
  * Yes: Re-enable all previously disabled FX
  * No: Keep them disabled and clear the list
  * Cancel: Don't change anything

CUSTOMIZATION:
--------------
To change the PDC threshold, edit "Set block size to 128.lua":
  Line 10: local PDC_THRESHOLD = 128  -- Change this value

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- js_ReaScriptAPI extension (install from ReaPack)
- SWS extension (https://www.sws-extension.org/)
Both extensions are free and widely used in the Reaper community.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
----------------
- Disabled FX info is stored in project extended state
- FX are verified by GUID before re-enabling (safe if FX chain was modified)
- Track names and FX positions are stored for reference
